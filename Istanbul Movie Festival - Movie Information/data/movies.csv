It could be the narrative of entirely different acts, in other places.

I wanted to incorporate these silent images into a story which combined the intimate with the social and with history, to convey the taste and colour of those years.’ The author of some twenty works of fiction and memoir, including A Man’s Place, A Woman’s Story, The Possession, The Years, and Happening, Annie Ernaux is considered by many to be France’s most important literary voice. David Ernoux-Briot says ‘I have always known these images, they have been part of me and have borne me for a long time.’ ‘A magical home movie-essay on marriage, motherhood, and the whole damn thing,’ according to Little White Lies, The Super 8 Years premiered within the Directors’ Fortnight at Cannes.",Documentary Time,http://film.iksv.org/en/the-42nd-istanbul-film-festival-2023/the-super-8-years

Lynch’s direct or suspected references and hidden images and symbols are seen and narrated by some of contemporary cinema’s most exciting voices: Karyn Kusama, John Waters, David Lowery, Rodney Ascher, Amy Nicholson, and Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead.

Turkish Delight,Turkish Delight,Pınar Öğrenci,108 min,"Drama, Romance",,7.1,0,,"Turkish Delight follows the story of the production of lokum (Turkish Delight), one of the most emblematic delicacies of Turkish culinary culture, that extends from Western Anatolia to the Greek island of Syros. Known as ’rahat-ul hulkum’ in Arabic and ’lokoumi’ in Greek, ’lokum’ came to be called as ’Turkish Delight’ at the end of the 19th century, when nationalist policies were introduced, and became the breadbasket for refugees fleeing the war that would soon begin. The film tells part of the story of Syros, which was built with the labour of Greek (Rum in Turkish) refugees from Anatolia and the islands, and focuses on the forced separation of peoples who lived together for centuries. Narrating the story of the forced displacement of two Greek families who escaped from Izmir and Istanbul and took shelter on Syros Island during the Turkish War of Independence, Turkish Delight brings together the survival stories of two couples from different generations. Visualized by the fragmented multiplicity of images, the narrative of the film points at the split historiography, fragmented cultural relations, and the psychological landscape of loss for refugees torn between the homeland and the port of arrival.",National Documentary Competition,http://film.iksv.org/en/the-42nd-istanbul-film-festival-2023/turkish-delight
The Water,EL AGUA,Elena López Riera,16 min,"Short, Drama",,6.9,0,,"Summertime in a small village in southeastern Spain... A storm threatens to cause the river crossing the village to overflow again. Throughout the village, an old popular belief is repeated like a litany, claiming that some women are predestined to disappear with each new flood, because they were born with ‘the water inside.’ Local teenagers try to survive the weariness of a summer in the village, smoking cigarettes, dancing and drinking. In this electric atmosphere preceding the storm, Ana, who dreams of fleeing this village that stinks of death, and José will live a story of summer love. Taking place in the town where the director Elena López Riera grew up, El Agua inspires from an existing legend: ‘There is a saint for rain and another to avoid too much rain. This ancestral fear of water, both desired and feared, has been passed on to women. Because at home, fears and taboos about sexuality are transmitted by the mother.’ Premiering within the Directors’ Fortnight section at Cannes 2022, El Agua employs mainly non-professional actors.",International Competition,http://film.iksv.org/en/the-42nd-istanbul-film-festival-2023/the-water

Casa Susanna,Casa Susanna,Sébastien Lifshitz,97 min,Documentary,,,0,,"In the 50s and 60s, deep in the American countryside at the foot of the Catskills region of New York, a small wooden house with a barn behind it was home to the first clandestine network of cross-dressers. Known as ‘Casa Susanna,’ the house provided a safe place for transgender women and cross-dressing men to express their true selves and live for a few days as they had always dreamed—without fear of being incarcerated or institutionalized for dressing as they wish. Told through the memories of those whose visits to the house would change their lives, the film provides a moving look back at a secret world where the persecuted and frightened found freedom, acceptance, and often, the courage to live their lives out of the shadows. It tells a story full of noise and fury, rich in extraordinary characters, including the famous Susanna Valenti, who created this refuge. The latest documentary by Sébastien Lifshitz, director of Little Girl and Bambi made its premiere at Venice Film Festival.",Documentary Time,http://film.iksv.org/en/the-42nd-istanbul-film-festival-2023/casa-susanna
