Set over the course of one winter, the film follows 17-year-old Lucas, when his teenage world is suddenly shattered upon a tragedy. He views his life as a wild animal in need of taming. Between a brother settled in Paris and a mother with whom he now lives alone, Lucas now has to fight to rediscover hope and love. Christophe Honor\u00e9, who also plays the father in the film, says: \u2018Maybe this is what the film is all about \u2013 how to turn tragedy into a joyful form of sorrow. This is why I think that the film is first and foremost a love story, not a melodrama, but a film that hopes for love.\u2019",

The director becomes part of the blurry landscape while waiting for inspiration and the right light. In Water, which is shot almost entirely out of focus, invites the audience to play a game; it moves forward with references to Hong Sang Soo\u2019s own filmography and life, tells its story with long dialogues, and is never afraid to take risks.",

Already praised as one of Ozon\u2019s best films, The Crime Is Mine is a mischievous drama and detective comedy set in the 1930s, where two friends, Madeleine and Pauline take advantage of the gullibility and idiocy of all the men they meet.

The absolutely hilarious film follows Madeleine Verdier, a young, pretty, penniless and untalented actress, who is accused of murdering a famous producer.

Alexandre O. Philippe, similar to his earlier examinations Leap of Faith: William Friedkin on the Exorcist, MEMORY: The Origins of Alien, and The People vs. George Lucas, dives deep into David Lynch\u2019s fascination (or obsession) with The Wizard of Oz, looking at his films from Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive, and Twin Peaks, to even his short The Grandmother. Lynch\u2019s direct or suspected references and hidden images and symbols are seen and narrated by some of contemporary cinema\u2019s most exciting voices: Karyn Kusama, John Waters, David Lowery, Rodney Ascher, Amy Nicholson, and Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead.

        "description": "Turkish Delight follows the story of the production of lokum (Turkish Delight), one of the most emblematic delicacies of Turkish culinary culture, that extends from Western Anatolia to the Greek island of Syros. Known as \u2019rahat-ul hulkum\u2019 in Arabic and \u2019lokoumi\u2019 in Greek, \u2019lokum\u2019 came to be called as \u2019Turkish Delight\u2019 at the end of the 19th century, when nationalist policies were introduced, and became the breadbasket for refugees fleeing the war that would soon begin. The film tells part of the story of Syros, which was built with the labour of Greek (Rum in Turkish) refugees from Anatolia and the islands, and focuses on the forced separation of peoples who lived together for centuries. Narrating the story of the forced displacement of two Greek families who escaped from Izmir and Istanbul and took shelter on Syros Island during the Turkish War of Independence, Turkish Delight brings together the survival stories of two couples from different generations. Visualized by the fragmented multiplicity of images, the narrative of the film points at the split historiography, fragmented cultural relations, and the psychological landscape of loss for refugees torn between the homeland and the port of arrival.",

        "description": "Summertime in a small village in southeastern Spain... A storm threatens to cause the river crossing the village to overflow again. Throughout the village, an old popular belief is repeated like a litany, claiming that some women are predestined to disappear with each new flood, because they were born with \u2018the water inside.\u2019 Local teenagers try to survive the weariness of a summer in the village, smoking cigarettes, dancing and drinking. In this electric atmosphere preceding the storm, Ana, who dreams of fleeing this village that stinks of death, and Jos\u00e9 will live a story of summer love. Taking place in the town where the director Elena L\u00f3pez Riera grew up, El Agua inspires from an existing legend: \u2018There is a saint for rain and another to avoid too much rain. This ancestral fear of water, both desired and feared, has been passed on to women. Because at home, fears and taboos about sexuality are transmitted by the mother.\u2019 Premiering within the Directors\u2019 Fortnight section at Cannes 2022, El Agua employs mainly non-professional actors.",
